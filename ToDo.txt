To-Do List:
- MOST IMPORTANT
	- USERS ADD ALBUMS ONTO CUSTOM LISTS
	  - Or just list of all listened to / rated albums
	- USERS RATE ALBUMS
	  - 1-10 rating
	- Send UID data to server for lots of functions

- Add ability to rate albums for each user

- Search specifically by User, Album, Artist (?)

- Add DMs (?) -- probably not going to happen
	- can send text, images, songs, albums, artists, ...
	- group DMs AND individual DMs
- Add user lists
	- maybe just top 5 / 10 list?
		- top 5 songs / top 5 albums / top 5 artists
		- could maybe show this on profile
- Show songs for each album on album page

- Add more artists, albums, songs to database
	- probably wait until later to do this
