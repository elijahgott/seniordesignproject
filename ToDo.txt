To-Do List:
------------------ MOST IMPORTANT ------------------


------------------ LESS IMPORTANT ------------------

	- Add DMs -- probably not going to happen
	  - can send text, images, songs, albums, artists, ...
	  - group DMs AND individual DMs

	- Show songs for each album on album page -- doable, not important

	- Submit photos in app

	- Add more artists, albums, songs to database

  - Do I need to keep albums / artists in database?
    - Maybe could only store albums added to user lists, just use Spottify API for rest?
