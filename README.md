This project uses React (https://react.dev/) to create the Frontend, Javascript for the Backend, and CSS for some styling.  
The SQL database was created using MySQL, and XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/) is used to run a local Apache server and a local MySQL server.  
To run a local server to view/debug the webpages, NPM is used (https://www.npmjs.com/).

(1) <.../seniordesignproject> cd Frontend 
(2) <.../seniordesignproject/Frontend> npm start
