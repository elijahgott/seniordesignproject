This is my unnamed senior design project, hence the "Music App" title. It is inspired by Letterboxd (https://letterboxd.com/), which I have found useful for tracking the movies I want to watch and have already watched, and rating them. In a previous course, a partner and I made a similar, yet very simple, application for video games, so it felt natural for my Senior Design Project to be in the same vein, but expanded upon.

This project uses React (https://react.dev/) for the Frontend, Javascript for the Backend, and CSS for some styling.  
The SQL database was created using MySQL (https://www.mysql.com/), and XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/) is used to run a local Apache server and a local MySQL server.  
To run the local server to view/debug the webpages, NPM is used (https://www.npmjs.com/).

To run frontend in local server from terminal:
(1) <.../seniordesignproject> cd Frontend 
(2) <.../seniordesignproject/Frontend> npm start 

To run backend in local server from terminal:
(1) <.../seniordesignproject> cd Backend
(2) <.../seniordesignproject/Backend> npm start
