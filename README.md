This project uses React (https://react.dev/) to create the Frontend, Javascript for the Backend, and CSS for some styling.  
The SQL database was created using MySQL, and XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/) is used to run a local Apache server and a local MySQL server.  
To run a local server to view/debug the webpages, NPM is used (https://www.npmjs.com/).

To run frontend in local server from terminal:
<.../seniordesignproject> cd Frontend 
<.../seniordesignproject/Frontend> npm start 

To run backend in local server from terminal:
<.../seniordesignproject> cd Backend
<.../seniordesignproject/Backend> npm start
